# BILLSense Backend Security Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the BILLSense application to protect sensitive information such as API keys and user data.

## Backend Structure

The backend code is organized into a dedicated directory structure:

```
src/
  backend/
    config.ts              # Centralized configuration (server-side only)
    services/              # Backend services
      authService.ts       # Authentication service
      exchangeRateService.ts  # Exchange rate service
  routes/
    api/
      exchange-rate/       # Public API endpoints (safe for client use)
```

This organization separates backend concerns from frontend code and provides a clear structure for security.

## Security Architecture

The security architecture follows a clear separation between:
1. **Backend code** - Server-side only, can access environment variables
2. **Public API endpoints** - Interface between client and server, exposing only safe data
3. **Frontend services** - Client-side code that only communicates with public APIs

This prevents any accidental leakage of sensitive information to the client.

## Environment Variables

All sensitive information is stored in environment variables and accessed through the centralized config module, which imports from SvelteKit's `$env/static/private` module. This ensures these values are only available on the server side and never exposed to clients.

Required environment variables:
- `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY`: API key for the Exchange Rate API
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token generation

## API Key Security

### Exchange Rate API

The Exchange Rate API key is secured through the following measures:

1. The key is stored as an environment variable
2. All environment variables are centralized in `backend/config.ts` (server-side only)
3. Backend services use the API key directly from the config
4. Public API endpoints expose only the calculated results, never the API keys
5. Frontend services call public endpoints that don't expose sensitive data

This multi-layered approach ensures API keys remain secure on the server.

## Authentication (Future Implementation)

The authentication system is designed with the following components:

1. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication
2. Token validation middleware for protected endpoints
3. Server-side validation of all API requests

## Security Best Practices

- No sensitive information is stored in client-side code
- All API keys and credentials are kept server-side
- Environment-specific configuration via .env files
- .env files are excluded from version control
- Example .env file provided for developer guidance
- Centralized configuration in `backend/config.ts`
- Strict separation between frontend and backend code

## Development vs. Production

In development:
- Basic security measures are in place
- Authentication token validation is optional

In production:
- Full security measures should be enabled
- Authentication token validation should be enforced
- HTTPS should be used for all communication

## Future Enhancements

Planned security enhancements include:
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Full JWT implementation with proper token verification
- User authentication system with secure password storage
- Role-based access control for different API endpoints
